    <p>A <strong>genre</strong> is defined in Grove Music Online as &quot;A class, type or category, sanctioned by convention&quot;<sup>[1]</sup> A music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
      Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Some[who?] do not believe that generic classification of music is possible in any logically consistent way. They argue that doing so sets limitations and boundaries that hinder the development of music. It is possible to note similarities between musical pieces, but it is difficult to do so in a systematic and universal manner.</p>
    <p> There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book Form in Tonal Music, Douglass M. Green lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. According to Green, &quot;Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre – both are violin concertos – but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the Agnus Dei from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms genre and style as the same, saying that genre should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or &quot;basic musical language&quot;.<sup>[3]</sup> Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that genre and style are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.<sup>[4]</sup> A music genre or sub-genre may be defined by the musical techniques, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of sub-genres.</p>
    <p> Kembrew McLeod has suggested that, in electronic music, &quot;the naming of new subgenres can be linked to a variety of influences, such as the rapidly evolving nature of the music, accelerated consumer culture, and the synergy created by record company marketing strategies and music magazine hype. The appropriation of the musics of minorities by straight, middle and upper-middle-class Whites in the United States and Great Britain plays a part, and the rapid and ongoing naming process within electronic/dance music subcultures acts as a gate-keeping mechanism, as well.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup></p>
    <p> Among the criteria often used to classify musical genres are:[citation needed] the trichotomy of art, popular and traditional; time period; regional and national origins; technique and instrumentation; fusional origins; and social function.</p>
    <p>Musicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomic distinction such as Philip Tagg's &quot;axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics&quot;.[6] He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
    <h2> Art music </h2>
    <p> The term art music refers primarily to classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<sup>[7]</sup> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<sup>[8]</sup> preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music usually are.<sup>[8][9]</sup> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a &quot;work&quot; or &quot;piece&quot; of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance. This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, even though jazz is primarily a form of popular music. </p>
    <h2> Popular music</h2>
    <p> The term popular music refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:</p>
    <p> &quot;Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise ... it should ideally sell as much as possible.&quot; <sup>[6]</sup></p>
    <p> Popular music is found on most commercial radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the Billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.</p>
    <p> The distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<sup>[10]</sup> such as minimalist music and light classics. In this respect music is like fiction, which likewise draws a distinction between classics and popular fiction that is not always precise.</p>
    <h2> Traditional music</h2>
    <p>Traditional music is a modern name for what has been called &quot;folk music&quot;, excluding the expansion of the term folk music to include much non-traditional material. The defining characteristics of traditional music are:</p>
    <p><strong>Oral transmission</strong>: The music is handed down and learned through singing, listening, and sometimes dancing;</p>
    <p> <strong>Cultural basis:</strong> The music derives from and is part of the traditions of a particular region or culture.</p>
